Compiler Breakdown: How to Build and Execute a Compiler
Overview:
In this guide, we break down the steps of compiling, assembling, linking, and executing a simple program, from source code to an executable. Tools such as C++, LLVM, GCC, NASM, and GNU Linkers play key roles in this process.

Steps to Create and Run a Simple Compiler
1. Write Source Code
Write code in your preferred language (e.g., C++).
2. Compile the Source Code
Pass the source code to your compiler (e.g., g++).
The compiler generates assembly code (e.g., myprog.s).
3. Assemble
Use an assembler like NASM to generate an object file (e.g., myprog.o).
4. Link
Link object files with libraries to create an executable (e.g., myprog.exe).
5. Execute
Run the executable file on the target machine.
Tools We Can Use
C++: Used to write the compiler.

Compiler Frameworks:

LLVM: Excellent for generating optimized assembly or machine code.
GCC/Clang: Useful for comparison or backend inspiration.
Assembler: NASM

Linker: GNU or platform-specific linkers.

Debugger: Tools like gdb to debug generated executables.

End-to-End Compiler Process
1. Front-end (Custom C++ Compiler)
Perform lexical analysis, parsing, and semantic analysis.
Build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) or other high-level representations.
Create the necessary instructions to perform basic operations (e.g., load values into registers, perform system calls).
2. Back-End (NASM Assembly)
Use NASM to convert assembly code into machine code for a specific architecture (e.g., x86-64).
Handle low-level details like register manipulation and system calls.
3. Execution
Link the object file into an executable or run the generated machine code directly.
